# Programming and techniques

## Objective

This project is responsible to save simple codes and snippets from training in programming and techniques using C++ language.

## Guideline

The exercises and contents follow the guideline [in this course](https://neps.academy)

 - [ ] 1. Basic of C++
 - [ ] 2. Graph Algorithms
 - [ ] 3. Data Structure
 - [ ] 4. Computational Math


## Result

As a result, I expect not only show code resolution, but also contribute with some teorical aspects too.
This will help me in the *Algorithm and Graphs* and *Compiler* subjetcs at graduation.
